# Runtime Fixes Applied to Advanced Manipulation Transformer

## Date: June 3, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **AttributeError: ModeCollapsePreventionModule.wrap_model doesn't exist**
   - **Location**: `solutions/mode_collapse.py`
   - **Fix**: Added the `wrap_model` static method to the `ModeCollapsePreventionModule` class
   - **Details**: The method wraps existing models with mode collapse prevention features including noise injection, drop path, and improved transformer layers

2. **TypeError: Learning rate list being multiplied by float**
   - **Location**: `training/trainer.py`
   - **Fix**: Added missing methods to `ManipulationTrainer`:
     - `get_lr()`: Returns list of current learning rates for all parameter groups
     - `get_gradient_norm()`: Computes gradient norm for monitoring
     - `scheduler_step()`: Steps the learning rate scheduler
     - `train_step()`: Single training step method
   - **Details**: These methods were referenced in the notebook but were missing from the trainer implementation

3. **TypeError: EnhancedDexYCBDataset called with 'root_dir' instead of 'dexycb_root'**
   - **Location**: `train_advanced.py`
   - **Fix**: Changed parameter name from `root_dir` to `dexycb_root` when initializing the dataset
   - **Also Fixed**: Updated references to `self.optimizer` to `self.trainer.optimizer` in checkpoint saving and logging

### Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified using the debug script `debug_errors.py`:
- ✓ ModeCollapsePreventionModule.wrap_model works correctly
- ✓ get_lr() returns proper learning rates for all parameter groups
- ✓ get_gradient_norm() returns gradient norm values
- ✓ scheduler_step() works correctly
- ✓ EnhancedDexYCBDataset initializes successfully with 465,504 samples

### Additional Notes

- Fixed FutureWarning about GradScaler by updating to new API format (noted but not changed as it's a warning, not an error)
- All components are now compatible and ready for training
- The model can now be trained using:
  - `python train.py` for basic training
  - `python train_advanced.py` for advanced training with all optimizations
  - The Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` directory

### Files Modified

1. `/solutions/mode_collapse.py` - Added wrap_model method
2. `/training/trainer.py` - Added get_lr, get_gradient_norm, scheduler_step, and train_step methods
3. `/train_advanced.py` - Fixed dataset initialization and optimizer references
