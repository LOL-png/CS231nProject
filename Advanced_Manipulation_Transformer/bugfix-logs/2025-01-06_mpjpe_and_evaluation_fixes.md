# MPJPE and Evaluation Fixes - 2025-01-06

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MPJPE Validation Always 0

**Problem**: During training, MPJPE values were always showing as 0.

**Root Cause**: The training loop in cell 23 was looking for `'hand_joints_3d'` in the batch, but the GPU cached dataset returns ground truth hand joints as `'hand_joints'`.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
if 'hand_joints' in outputs and 'hand_joints_3d' in batch:
    mpjpe = torch.norm(outputs['hand_joints'] - batch['hand_joints_3d'], dim=-1).mean()

# After (correct):
if 'hand_joints' in outputs and 'hand_joints' in batch:
    mpjpe = torch.norm(outputs['hand_joints'] - batch['hand_joints'], dim=-1).mean()
```

**Files Changed**:
- `notebooks/train_full_featured.ipynb` - Cell 23 (training loop)

### 2. Evaluation Block FP32 JSON Serialization Error

**Problem**: The evaluation block (cell 25) was failing with "Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable" when trying to save results.

**Root Cause**: NumPy data types (float32, int64, etc.) cannot be directly serialized to JSON. The `save_results` method in the evaluator was trying to save raw numpy values.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Added type conversion in save_results method:
json_results = {}
for key, value in self.results.items():
    if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):
        json_results[key] = value.tolist()
    elif isinstance(value, (np.float32, np.float64)):
        json_results[key] = float(value)
    elif isinstance(value, (np.int32, np.int64)):
        json_results[key] = int(value)
    else:
        json_results[key] = value
```

**Files Changed**:
- `evaluation/evaluator.py` - `save_results` method

## Impact

1. **MPJPE Tracking**: Training and validation will now show actual MPJPE values instead of 0, allowing proper monitoring of model performance.

2. **Evaluation Saving**: The evaluation results can now be properly saved to JSON files without serialization errors.

## Testing

To verify these fixes:
1. Run training and check that MPJPE values are non-zero
2. Run evaluation and verify that the JSON file is created successfully
3. Check that saved metrics are properly formatted numbers

## Related Issues

These fixes are minimal changes that don't affect the overall architecture or training process. They simply correct:
- Data key mismatch in the training loop
- JSON serialization compatibility for evaluation results
