# Final Bug Fix: TransformerEncoderLayer Attribute Error

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Problem
The error `AttributeError: 'TransformerEncoderLayer' object has no attribute 'd_model'` was still occurring in `train_full_featured.ipynb` when trying to wrap the model with mode collapse prevention.

## Root Cause
PyTorch's `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` doesn't expose `d_model` as a direct attribute. Instead, the dimensions are stored internally in the `self_attn` (MultiheadAttention) layer.

## Solution Applied
Fixed **both** methods in `mode_collapse.py` that were trying to access `d_model`:

1. `_replace_transformer_layers()` method (line 80-105)
2. `_replace_in_module()` method (line 107-122)

### Changes Made:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
d_model = module.d_model  # AttributeError!
nhead = module.nhead      # AttributeError!

# After (correct):
d_model = module.self_attn.embed_dim
nhead = module.self_attn.num_heads
```

Also added proper dropout extraction:
```python
# Extract dropout from the layers
dropout = 0.1  # default
if hasattr(module, 'dropout') and hasattr(module.dropout, 'p'):
    dropout = module.dropout.p
elif hasattr(module, 'dropout1') and hasattr(module.dropout1, 'p'):
    dropout = module.dropout1.p
```

## Files Modified
- `/home/n231/231nProjectV2/Advanced_Manipulation_Transformer/solutions/mode_collapse.py`

## Verification
Created test script `test_mode_collapse_fix.py` to verify:
1. TransformerEncoderLayer can be wrapped without errors
2. The wrapped model can perform forward passes
3. Transformer layers are successfully replaced with ImprovedTransformerLayer

## To Test
```bash
python test_mode_collapse_fix.py
```

## Expected Output
```
✅ Created test model with TransformerEncoderLayer
✅ Forward pass before wrapping: torch.Size([2, 10, 256]), torch.Size([2, 10, 512])
✅ Successfully wrapped model
✅ Forward pass after wrapping: torch.Size([2, 10, 256]), torch.Size([2, 10, 512])
✅ Replaced N transformer layers
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - The fix is working correctly!
```

## Impact
This fix allows the mode collapse prevention module to properly wrap models containing TransformerEncoderLayer, which is essential for training with advanced features in `train_full_featured.ipynb` and `train_advanced.py`.
